# Smart_Library_System
## 📚 Library Management System (Python OOP)

This is a simple **Library Management System** built in **Python** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as **Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Classes**.  
The system allows a librarian to manage books and library members, while users (members) can borrow and return books easily.

### ✅ Features

#### 👨‍💼 Librarian
- Add new books to the library
- Remove books by ID
- Add new members
- Remove existing members
- View all available books
- View registered members

#### 👨‍🎓 Member
- Borrow books from the library
- Return borrowed books
- View list of borrowed books
- View available books

### 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

### 🔧 OOP Concepts Applied
- **Encapsulation** → Private book ID (`__id`)
- **Inheritance** → `Member` and `Librarian` inherit from `User`
- **Abstraction** → Clean design and methods
- **Polymorphism** (optional future enhancement)

### 🚀 How to Run
```bash
python library.py
